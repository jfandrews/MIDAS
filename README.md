The Irradiation component of this software contains commands for control and access of lasers associated with a Nikon A1r confocal microscope. Lasers are a potential health hazard and should be operated with all safety precautions in place.  The included script uses hardware specific commands and may result in unexpected behaviors if used without adaptation to the microscope system it is intended for.  It is strongly recommended that users contact the author Joel F. Andrews before attempting to implement this component, due to potential hardware and safety concerns. Users assume all responsbility for any and all outcomes of use of this software.
